        "Airbnb, Inc. is an American San Francisco-based company operating an online marketplace for short- and long-term homestays and experiences. The company acts as a broker and charges a commission from each booking. The company was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk, and Joe Gebbia. Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name, AirBedandBreakfast.com. The company is credited with revolutionizing the tourism industry, while also having been the subject of intense criticism by residents of tourism hotspot cities like Barcelona and Venice for enabling an unaffordable increase in home rents, and for a lack of regulation.\n",

Post loading the desired Airbnb dataset we will have relevant information such as id of the property, name of the property, host_id of the guest, room_type like private room or entire property for rent, price of the property based on the selection either private or entire, no.of reviews making it easy for guests to know more about property before making booking etc. The dataset comprises of 48895 rows × 16 columns.\n",

        "We will remove all the null values, handle missing data, set up outliers. By the end of this projects we will have a clear and crisp data. A concluding statement will eventually mark the completion of this project, hence leaving a powerful data insight for audience to view and use for their projects further.."

        "1. We have done data wrangling on the previous dataset provided which had some missing values.\n",
        "2. As we initiated **drop_duplicates()** method but didn't find any duplicate values in the dataset.\n",
        "3. Then we performed **isnull()** to find null values and concluded that we have 4 columns with some null values.\n",
        "4. For **name** and **host_name** column replaced **NaN** with **unknown** as null values very less in number. We could have dropped the columns but it would then remove some meaningful data as well.\n",
        "5. We then replaced the null values in **reviews_per_month** column with **0** as it didn't impact the meaning of dataset.\n",
        "6. Since **last_review** has numerous null values and the info contained in it is almost there in **reviews_per_momth** column, so we dropped it off.\n",
        "7. We transformed the **price** column, since property can't be available just for free i.e., 0 price. So, we replaced all price 0 with mean price value.\n",
        "8. Hence we can say we got a processed and clean dataset."
