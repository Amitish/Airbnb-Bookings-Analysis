# Airbnb-Bookings-Analysis
EDA Project on Airbnb Bookings Analysis 

Project Summary -
The agenda of this project/EDA will be to analyse Airbnb bookings dataset and pull fruitful information out of it. Moreover perform data cleaning, data transformation in order to get processed data.

Airbnb, Inc. is an American San Francisco-based company operating an online marketplace for short- and long-term homestays and experiences. The company acts as a broker and charges a commission from each booking. The company was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk, and Joe Gebbia. Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name, AirBedandBreakfast.com. The company is credited with revolutionizing the tourism industry, while also having been the subject of intense criticism by residents of tourism hotspot cities like Barcelona and Venice for enabling an unaffordable increase in home rents, and for a lack of regulation.

This colab notebook will hold every informative data that will give a brief overview of Airbnb dataset insight. Post loading the desired Airbnb dataset we will have relevant information such as id of the property, name of the property, host_id of the guest, room_type like private room or entire property for rent, price of the property based on the selection either private or entire, no.of reviews making it easy for guests to know more about property before making booking etc. The dataset comprises of 48895 rows Ã— 16 columns.

We will remove all the null values, handle missing data, set up outliers. By the end of this projects we will have a clear and crisp data. A concluding statement will eventually mark the completion of this project, hence leaving a powerful data insight for audience to view and use for their projects further.
